On 3/29/2024, the ACLU of Ohio filed a lawsuit on behalf of abortion providers challenging the 24-hour waiting period restriction. In Ohio, patients must have an in-person consultation 24-hours before they are allowed to receive an abortion. This same law requires abortion providers to hand out state-mandated materials that discourage the patient from proceeding with their abortion. There is no medical need for these materials or the 24-hour waiting period. The lawsuit argues that, under The Right to Reproductive Freedom with Exceptions for Health and Safety Amendment,\\n---\\nYes - Abortion is Legal in Ohio\\n\\nThe 24-hour waiting period restriction is unconstitutional as it creates an undue burden on patients that prevents them from easily accessing reproductive healthcare.

On 3/29/2024, the ACLU of Ohio filed a lawsuit on behalf of abortion providers challenging the 24-hour waiting period restriction. In Ohio, patients must have an in-person consultation 24-hours before they are allowed to receive an abortion. This same law requires abortion providers to hand out state-mandated materials that discourage the patient from proceeding with their abortion. There is no medical need for these materials or the 24-hour waiting period. The lawsuit argues that, under The Right to Reproductive Freedom with Exceptions for Health and Safety Amendment,\\n---\\nYes - Abortion is Legal in Ohio\\n\\nThe 24-hour waiting period restriction is unconstitutional as it creates an undue burden on patients that prevents them from easily accessing reproductive healthcare. Abortion providers are seeking a temporary injunction while the case plays out in court. As of right now, that request has not been granted and the 24-hour waiting period (and all related restrictions) remains in place. Where Can I Get an Abortion in Ohio?

This same law requires abortion providers to hand out state-mandated materials that discourage the patient from proceeding with their abortion.
