county that borders to any extent the county in which she has a residence or legal settlement, or the juvenile court of the county in which the hospital, clinic, or other facility in which the abortion would be performed or induced is located, and has given the court written notice of the name and address of the person who intends to perform or induce the abortion;\\n- The specified brother, sister, stepparent, or grandparent has executed an affidavit stating that the woman has reason to fear physical, sexual, or severe\\n---\\nemotional abuse from the parent, guardian, or custodian who otherwise would be notified under division (B)(1)(a)(i) of this section, based on a pattern of physical, sexual, or severe emotional abuse of her by that parent, guardian, or custodian, and the woman or the specified brother, sister, stepparent, or grandparent has filed the affidavit with the juvenile court in which the affidavit described in division (B)(1)(b)(ii) of this section was filed;\\n\\n(iv) The juvenile court in which the affidavits described in divisions (B)(1)(b)(ii) and (iii) of this section were filed has notified the person that both of those affidavits have been filed with the court.\\n\\n(c) If an affidavit of the type described in division (B)(1)(b)(ii) of this section and an affidavit of the type described in division (B)(1)(b)(iii) of this section are filed with a juvenile court and the court has been provided with written notice of the name and address of the person who intends to perform or induce an abortion upon the woman to whom the affidavits pertain, the court promptly shall notify the person who intends to perform or induce the abortion that the affidavits have been filed. If possible, the notice to the person shall be given in person or by telephone.\\n\\n(2) If division (B)(1)(a)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section does not apply, and if no parent, guardian, or custodian can be reached for purposes of division (B)(1)(a)(i) of this section\\n---\\nAfter a reasonable effort, or if notification is to be given to a specified brother, sister, stepparent, or grandparent under that division and the specified brother, sister, stepparent, or grandparent cannot be reached for purposes of that division after a reasonable effort, no person shall perform or induce such an abortion without giving at least forty-eight hours constructive notice to one of the woman's parents, her guardian, or her custodian, by both certified and ordinary mail sent to the last known address of the parent, guardian, or custodian, or if notification for purposes of division (B)(1)(a)(i) of this section is to be given to a specified brother, sister, stepparent, or grandparent, without giving at least forty-eight hours constructive notice to that specified brother, sister, stepparent, or grandparent by both certified and ordinary mail sent to the last known address of that specified brother, sister, stepparent, or grandparent. The forty-eight-hour period under this division begins when the certified mail notice is mailed. If a parent, guardian, or custodian of the woman, or if notification under division (B)(1)(a)(i) of this section is to be given to a specified brother, sister, stepparent, or grandparent, the specified brother, sister, stepparent, or grandparent, is not reached within the forty-eight-hour period, the abortion may proceed even if the certified mail notice is not received.\\n\\nIf a parent, guardian, custodian, or specified brother, sister, stepparent, or grandparent who has been notified\\n---\\nin accordance with division (B)(1) or (2) of this section clearly and unequivocally expresses that he or she does not wish to consult with a pregnant woman prior to her abortion, then the abortion may proceed without any further waiting period.\\n\\nFor purposes of prosecutions for a violation of division (B)(1) or (2) of this section, it shall be a rebuttable presumption that a woman who is unmarried and under eighteen years of age is unemancipated.\\n\\nIt is an affirmative defense to a charge under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section that the pregnant woman provided the person who performed or induced the abortion with false, misleading, or incorrect information about her age, marital status, or emancipation, about the age of a brother or sister to whom she requested notice be given as a specified relative instead of to one of her parents, her guardian, or her custodian, or about the last known address of either of her parents, her guardian, her custodian, or a specified brother, sister, stepparent, or grandparent to whom she requested notice be given and the person who performed or induced the abortion did not otherwise have reasonable cause to believe the pregnant woman was under eighteen years of age, unmarried, or unemancipated, to believe that the age of a brother or sister to whom she requested notice be given as a specified relative instead of to one of her parents, her guardian, or her custodian was not\\n---\\ntwenty-one years of age, or to believe that the last known address of either of her parents, her guardian, her custodian, or a specified brother, sister, stepparent, or grandparent to whom she requested notice be given was incorrect.\\n\\n(2) It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that compliance with the requirements of this section was not possible because an immediate threat of serious risk to the life or physical health of the pregnant woman from the continuation of her pregnancy created an emergency necessitating the immediate performance or inducement of an abortion.\\n\\n(D) Whoever violates this section is guilty of unlawful abortion. A violation of division (A) of this section is a misdemeanor of the first degree on the first offense and a felony of the fourth degree on each subsequent offense. A violation of division (B) of this section is a misdemeanor of the first degree on a first offense and a felony of the fifth degree on each subsequent offense.\\n\\n(E) Whoever violates this section is liable to the pregnant woman and her parents, guardian, or custodian for civil compensatory and exemplary damages.\\n\\n(F) As used in this section \\\"unemancipated\\\" means that a woman who is unmarried and under eighteen years of age has not entered the armed services of the United States,\\n---\\nhas not become employed and self-subsisting, or has not\\notherwise become independent from the care and control\\nof her parent, guardian, or custodian.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"pexJ25A6sHgxDP7XqTHRhql+J06UQmbEpwTcGKoRIdI=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"619acd01-0bac-4ac6-a61c-c3112ab0dd2f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"619acd01-0bac-4ac6-a61c-c3112ab0dd2f\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/Users/riyaranjan/Stanford/2023-2024/CS221/project/abortionaid/data/data/OHIO_4.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"OHIO_4.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"5/23/24, 10:50 AM\\n\\nYes - Abortion is Legal in Ohio\\n\\nY E S\\n\\nAbortion is Legal in Ohio\\n\\nhttps://www.abortionislegalinohio.com/#:~:text=In Ohio%2C patients must have,from proceeding with their abortion. 1/15\\n---\\nAbortion is still legal and providers in Ohio can currently see patients up to 21 weeks and 6 days gestation.\\n\\nhttps://www.abortionislegalinohio.com/#:~:text=In Ohio%2C patients must have,from proceeding with their abortion.\\n---\\nYes - Abortion is Legal in Ohio\\n\\nAn Ohio court has placed a restraining order against the law that bans abortion after cardiac activity has been detected.
